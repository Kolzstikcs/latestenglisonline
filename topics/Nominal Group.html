        <p>A noun group (phrase or clause) is a group
            of words that is made up of a noun or pronoun and words to describe that noun or
            pronoun. It is a group of words that has a noun or a noun equivalent as its
            headword. Within a nominal group, the headword (h) can appear alone, it can be
            preceded by a modifier (m) and a qualifier (q) can also appear after it. Take
            note that the modifier and the qualifier are optional since, as we have said,
            the headword can appear alone.</p>

            <p>Take note also that, a group can be defined as a word or a combination of words that has a head word. If a combination of words does not have a headword, it cannot be referred to as a group.<b> A headword is therefore the obligatory element of a group</b>. When a group contains a single word, it is referred to as a single group but when it consists of more than one word, it is known as a complex group.</p>

            <p>
                Every lexical word in English has (there is) a group that corresponds to it. 
            </p>
            <p>Examples</p>

            <p><b>Teachers</b>
            <br>
            <b>Brilliant teachers are nominal groups.</b></p>

            <p>
               <b>Eat</b> 
                <br>
<b>Will have eaten </b> are verbal groups.
<br>
<b>Wonderful</b>

<br>
<b>Extremely wonderful</b>
 are adjectival groups.
<br>
<b>Fast and extraordinarily fast </b> are adverbial groups

            </p>
<p>The phrase is a group of words which does not make a complete sense. It also does not have a finite verb e g. ï¿½In the cupboard, coming out of the room, before his arrival. 
    <br>
    Take note that the verb if there is any in any phrasal group is always infinite while the verb in a clause is finite.
    <br>
    A finite verb is one which simply states the action with reference to persons or number and tenses such as we come The person here is the second person and the number is plural while the tense is present tense.
    <br>
    A nonfinite verb simply states action without reference to persons, number or tenses, (the non- finite verb does not change in the sentence) such as <b> to see, to jump, writing, (gerunds) nominalized verbs which take the ed/ en forms</b>.
    </p>
<p>Remember that a phrase plays the part in a sentence as a part of speech e. g. a noun, an adverb, or an adjective. E.g. My speech was interesting. The words in bold letters is a noun phrase playing the part of a subject of the verb in the sentence.
    <br>
    The lady <b> with white hands gloves</b> is the hostess. The expression with <b> white hands gloves</b> is an adjectival phrase describing the noun lady.
    <br>
    He came back within an hour. The phrase <b> within an hour</b> is an adverbial phrase modifying the verb came.
